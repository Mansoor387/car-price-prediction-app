# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction App

A machine learning project to predict the **selling price of used cars** based on various features such as present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, owner history, and car age. The model is trained using **Random Forest Regressor** and deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive prediction.
